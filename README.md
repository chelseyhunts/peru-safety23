# Data and Code for the paper "The relative importance of safety cues from mixed-species flocks to a neotropical bird community"
# Data management and analysis code finalized Jan31,2025
# 23SafetyTFLA, contains data management for all trials completed in tierra firme forests
# 23SafetyVLA, contains data management for all trials completed in varzea forests
# CombineTFVA.23Safety, contains data management for combining the above two datasets
# GLMSafety2025, contains code for GLM analysis -- responses to safety cues
# LMSafety, contains code for LM analysis -- net distance individuals moved before and after stimulus
# ForagingStrategyResponders, contains code for Fisher's Exact Test -- do responders differ from expected in foraging strategy to significant playback species

# Data files are:
# 23safetycueTFLA, contains raw data for trials completed in tierra firme forests
# 23TFLA.MASTER, contains metadata for each tierra firme trial
# 23safetycueVLA, contains raw data for trials completed in varzea forests
# 23VLA.MASTER, comtains metadata for each varzea trial
# Safety23, contains manipulated data with recruits for each trial for both forest types
# net.dist.TFLA23, contains movement data for trials completed in tierra firme
# net.dist.VLA23, contains movement data for trials completed in varzea
# net.dist.23, contains movement data for both forest types
# Responders_Foraging_Ecology, contains species observed in trials and foraging maneuver and subtrate 
# THAR_Responders_Foraging_Ecology, contains species that responded to THAR treatments
# THAR_Spp_Detected_Foraing_Ecology, contains species detected in trials where THAR treatment was played
# MYLO_Responders_Foraging_Ecology, contains species that responded to MYLO treatments
# MYLO_Spp_Detected_Foraing_Ecology, contains species detected in trials where MYLO treatment was played
